# Organizing Bears Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use SQL to store data and retrieve it later on.
- Use SQLite to build relational databases on your computer.
- Perform CRUD operations on relational databases using SQL.

*** 

## Key Vocab

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: a programming language that is used to
  manage relational databases and perform operations on the data that they contain.
- **Relational Database**: a collection of data that is organized in
  well-defined relationships. The most common type of database.
- **Query**: a statement used to return data from a database.
- **Table**: a collection of related data in a database. Composed of rows and
  columns. Similar to a class in Python.
- **Row**: a single record in a database table. Each column represents an
  attribute of the record. Similar to an object in Python.
- **Column**: a single field in a database table. Each row contains values in
  each column. Similar to a Python object’s attributes.
- **Schema**: a blueprint of the construction of the tables in a database and
  how they relate to one another.

## Lab Structure

This lab might seem a bit different than what you've seen before. Take a look at
the file structure and read the comments to understand what each file is used
for:

```txt
├── __init__.py        # designates "python-p3-organizing-bears-lab" as package
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
├── README.md
├── lib
    ├── __init__.py    # designates "lib" as package
│   ├── create.sql     # where you CREATE your schema
│   ├── insert.sql     # where you INSERT your data
│   ├── seed.sql       # data for in-memory test database
│   ├── sql_queries.py # where you write your SELECT queries
└── testing            # all the tests
    ├── __init__.py    # designates "testing" as package
    ├── create_test.py # this tests your create.sql file
    ├── insert_test.py # this tests your insert.sql file
    ├── select_test.py # this tests the queries you write in sql_queries.py
    └── conftest.py    # configuration for pytest
```

This lab uses the `sqlite3` module from Python's standard library to allow us
to connect to a SQL database from Python. How cool is that!? We'll use this
module more in the lessons to come.

### A Note on Testing

Let's briefly go over what is happening in setup blocks that our tests
will be using.

```py
connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")

cursor = connection.cursor()

create_file = open("lib/create.sql")
create_as_string = create_file.read()
cursor.executescript(create_as_string)
```

Before each test, two important things happen.

First, a new _in-memory_ database is created. Why do we do this instead of
creating a database file? Let's say we run our tests and they add ten items to
our database. If we did not use an in-memory store, those would be in there
forever. This way, our database gets thrown out after every running of the
tests. You can learn more about in-memory databases
[here](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html).

Next, the test opens the `.sql` file, and runs the SQL code in that file in
that in-memory database.

***

## Part 1: `CREATE TABLE`

Get the tests in `testing/create_test.py` to pass by writing code in the
`lib/create.sql` file. Your `CREATE` statement should look something like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bears (
  //columns here
);
```

Your columns should be the following types:

| column      | type    |
| ----------- | ------- |
| id          | integer |
| name        | text    |
| age         | integer |
| sex         | text    |
| color       | text    |
| temperament | text    |
| alive       | boolean |

Read about [SQLite3 Datatypes](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html) to
determine what your insert values are going to be. Be sure to pay attention to
how booleans are expressed in SQLite3.

***

## Part 2: `INSERT`

Get the tests in `testing/insert_test_.py` to pass by writing code in the
`lib/insert.sql` file. Input the following 8 bears (you can make up details
about them, but make sex either 'M' or 'F'):

- Mr. Chocolate
- Rowdy
- Tabitha
- Sergeant Brown
- Melissa
- Grinch
- Wendy
- unnamed (refer back to how to create a record that doesn't have one value)

***

## Part 3: `SELECT`

Get the tests in `testing/select_test.py` to pass. Note that for this section, the
database will be seeded with external data from the `lib/seed.sql` file so don't
expect it to reflect the data you added above.

**Note**: Since it's a Python file, write your queries as strings in the
`global` scope in the `lib/sql_queries.py` file. For example, to pass the first
test, your Python string should look like this:

```py
select_all_female_bears_return_name_and_age = """
    SELECT
        bears.name,
        bears.age
    FROM bears
    WHERE sex='F';
"""
```

You may be expected to use SQL statements that you're not particularly familiar
with. Make sure you use the resources and Google to find the right statements.
